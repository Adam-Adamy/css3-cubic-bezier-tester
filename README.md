CSS3 Cubic Bezier Tester
========================

This is a simple CSS3 bezier curve animation tester for your transitions for modern browsers. It's easy to compare your custom bezier animations with a standard linear animation.

This tool should help you to understand how the bezier curve and the modification of the two handles/values result in acceleration and feel.

It's based on HTML5, CSS3 and some JavaScript and should be run in any modern browser.
